# Task 2 - Clientside

Implement a basic frontend application which fulfills the following user stories:

Story 1

- As a **user running the application** 
- I want to **see a list of projects and key project metadata**
- So that I can **select a project to view more information**

Story 2

- As a **user running the application**
- I want to **see project actions and metadata when I select one**
- So that I can **view all relevant information relating to a project**

*We are not assessing your design capabilities and don't mind what the application looks like but please make sure it's legible and cleanly laid out.*

*We are interested in how you structure the project, how you implement data fetching and the code design decisions you make.*
